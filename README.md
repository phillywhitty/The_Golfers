## Visual Design
### Wireframes

### Fonts

</div>

- The primary font, San-Serif was selected due to its standard, straightforward, and informative nature, striking a balance between approachability and professionalism. It exudes a friendly and conversational tone while maintaining a sense of seriousness.

### Icons

</div>

- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
- Since they function as classes, they can be effortlessly customized using other classes or IDs within the same tag. I frequently employed Bootstrap classes to ensure consistent styling a 
  across different elements.
- Icons are employed in the footer for social media accounts.

### Colors

</div>

- I aimed for a minimal look on the site, using simple and clean colors to accentuate the photos.
- Using dark green as the primary color creates sharp contrast with the photos, drawing focus without distractions, aligning with theater practices. Unlike white, which relates to lighting, dark green enhances visual impact on screens emitting light.
- White text is used to stand out against the vibrant backgrounds of primary and accent colors.
- I incorporated orange in specific text and buttons to complement the green elements harmoniously.

## Credits and Contact
### Content
Nearly all text content was generated by the AI, GPT-4. Especially for blog text. It certainly helps and found it great at explaining certain terms but it can be very undependable in certain circumstances and I always double checked any text I generated using it.
Images were screenshots of the golfing websites and then I also used Canva.
